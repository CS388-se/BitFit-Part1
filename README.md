# Android Project 5 - *BitFit-Part1*

Submitted by: **Stephen Ebrahim**

**BitFit-Part1** is a health metrics app that allows users to track **the foods that they consume and their calories**.

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **At least one health metric is tracked (based on user input)**
  - Chosen metric(s): `Calories`
- [X] **There is a "create entry" UI that prompts users to make their daily entry**
- [X] **New entries are saved in a database and then updated in the RecyclerView**
- [X] **On application restart, previously entered entries are preserved (i.e., are *persistent*)**
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] **Create a UI for tracking averages and trends in metrics**
- [X] **Improve and customize the user interface through styling and coloring**
- [ ] **Implement orientation responsivity**
- [ ] **Add a daily photo feature**

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

Note: In the gif I show that data is persistent by both restarting the app through Android Studio and closing and reopening the app through the emulator.

## Notes

I had issues making sure that all the packages I need was included in the dependencies; other than that no issues.
